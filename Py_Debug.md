# Python Debugger

1. It simply ran the main function and ended the debugging doing almost nothing.
2. It ran through each line individually showing what it went through step by step including the steps of each individual function used.
3. The next command simply runs to the next part of the main program not located in functions whilst the step command steps through each individual command giving the exact detail of each individual function allowing us to see exactly where the issue was compared to the next function which is more useful for simply skipping through the code towards the part that you need to use step to more precisely navigate.
4. The whatis command returned the integer clasds and p total returned 500.
5. The whatis command returns the class of the variable telling what kind of datatype it is, whilst the p (print) command prints the current value of the variable allowing us to see the exact value of the variable at the given line of code compared to class of the variable.
